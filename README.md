### Description  
CUIDE-C is a game created with pygame library. It is a college project, which I do intend to take to a mobile platform in the future.  
It's a educational game for children. The intention is to teach them how to protect against the coronavirus pandemic while having some fun throughout the minigames.  
Every minigame has a different playstyle, and in the current available version, since it's exclusively for computers, it uses the Mouse and Keyboard to walkthrough the game.
